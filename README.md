A demo program to make histograms for given datasets with GPU and OpenCL

Note: This is a demo for 3-dimensional data cube aggregation. Multidimensional(more than 3) data cube is not supported yet(Although it's at the same with 3 dimensional cube)

Work finished:

Multicore cube generation using OpenCL

Multicore cell aggregation from generated cube aggregation using OpenCL

An evaluation function to determine which dimension is optimal to be aggregated in this time to reach target aggregation cube
